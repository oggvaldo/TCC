In a world where technological improvements are really quick, have the correct decision for a faster creation and/or adapt becomes more and more requested, asking for creating various methodologies which can help since the idealization, passing through the planning and implementing until the ending of those projects that were thought. With that challenge being applied for all the world, it would not be unthinkable that even on Artificial Intelligence area the agile software development were included. But, with this model we see how thinking on ethical implications using this technology becomes required to passthrough those challenges. On this work, we'll discuss how the agile methodology has impacted on the creation for a guide to help developers and stakeholders implementing those ethical principles at the Artificial Intelligence context. Besides that, it is presented how was the development for this guide and using the ECCOLA methodology, created by Vakkuri et al. \cite{ECCOLA} as a proof of concept for this tool, generating an immediate impact for potential users. We also show how to modify this tool to use with other methodologies with other parameters, user cases and future improvements, both on future projects and on this tool development.
